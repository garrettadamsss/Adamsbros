# Adams Brothers Website

## Overview
I built this website myself for my father's pool plastering company. This is my very first website and I intended to accomplish all of the needs of a website my father set. 

The website serves two main functions. The first is to be a space for sample photos for customers. The other is to create a simple way to submit a estimate request. The rest of the website is general information about the company such as contact information and the history of the company. 

PHP are used for the contact form using the main() function and sends the form information to the specified email. Both Javascript and PHP are used for input validation, while data clearing is used with just PHP. The website is responsive for all screen sizes using media queries. CSS animations and transitions are used throughout the website. Javascript is also used for creating a slide gallery for the home page. 

Currently, the website is in its initial version. It is in the process of being published, but it is available through github pages. There are small changes I would like to make to the website such as a streamlined gallery page and more information.
